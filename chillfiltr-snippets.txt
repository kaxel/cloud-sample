You don't have to say it dear
It's there in your eyes

When you are weary
Please know that it's true
I know that you'll be there for me honey
I'll be there
I'll be there for you
I know you're strong enough
Let me hear you say no, I'll never give up
The night is long, the road is rough
Let me hear you say no, I'll never give up
